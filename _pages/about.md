I am a PhD student at Autonomous & Intelligent Robotics Lab ([AIRO](https://github.com/HKPolyU-UAV)) in the Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by [Prof. Chih-yung Wen](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/aae/people/academic-staff/ir-prof-wen-chih-yung/) (ASME Fellow). 
I received my M.Eng degree in Control Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, supervised by [Prof. Max Q.-H. Meng](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/mengqh/) (IEEE Fellow).
Before that,  I received my B.Eng. degree in Measurement and Control Technology and Instrument from Nanjing Tech University, supervised by [Prof. Lihang Feng](https://eecs.njtech.edu.cn/info/1133/4859.htm) (IEEE Senior Member).
I also work closely with [Prof. Zhe Min](https://sucro.sdu.edu.cn/info/1012/1491.htm) at Shandong University, [Prof. Jiaole Wang](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/jlwang) and [Prof. Shuang Song](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/songshuang) at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen.

My research mainly concentrates on 3D vision and robot navigation (e.g., surgical and underwater scenarios). I solve problems by integrating optimization algorithms with deep learning. 
I currently work on topics about 3D generative models and point cloud registration.
